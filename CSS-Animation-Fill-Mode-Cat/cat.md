### CSS Fill-Mode Animation Exercise
Demonstates animating motion CSS using the fill-mode capability. Animations in CSS can be thought of as "playing a change" or even "playing as CD" as a viable metaphor; when you animate in CSS the code runs and stops when it reaches the end. If you want the animation to run again you have to tell it to do so and where to animate from (0% completed through 100% completion) just as you would tell a CD to "play from track 3" once it has ended. CSSs' "fill-mode" allows this to function.
