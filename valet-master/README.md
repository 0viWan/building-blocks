# "Valet: Voice-Automated Parking Assistance"

We created a potential solution for drivers in finding parking in urban areas in a manner that is not only completely hands-free and therefore safer than currently existing alternatives, but also effective and expedient. To do this with we synced up the technologies of the Amazon Echo hardware, the Amazon Alexa voice recognition API, and GE's Current street lamp sensor data API.

## Details
### Background

According to the [National Safety Council](http://www.nsc.org/pages/home.aspx), "cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year" and of those crashes "nearly 330,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving".

We entered the 2016 IOT Internet of Things Hackathon in Santa Clara, CA to combat these alarming statistics and delivered a hypotetical product that garnered a 1st place award from Amazon, as well as runner-ups in the Grand Prize placement of this hackathon.  

By interweaving the voice recognition capabilities of the Amazon Alexa API, with the hands-free hardware the Amazon Echo provides, and the pinged real-time car parking General Electric's Current API allots from street lights in the test-pilot district of Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego, we were able to simulate a viable, safe, and effective tool to aid parking in metropolitan areas.  


### What It Does
A user who drives has a hypothetical, mobile version of the Amazon Echo mounted in their car . The user prompts the Amazon Alexa API by saying "Alexa, Start Valet", without the need to take their hands off the wheel or their eyes off the road. The web app compares the product to what we have in the database of products that MAY be the result of labor trafficking, with image recognition or logo recognition.  If the product is something that MAY be the result of labor trafficking, it will show people alternate options.

For now, this web app works on chocolate, because that is the product that we happen to have the most data on.  But we plan to expand the product list.  

In addition to promoting fair trade products, we also make all of our code and data open-source and available for other people who would want to contribute or improve it.
